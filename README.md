# DynamicWallpaper
DynamicWallpaper is a Python script that you can run in the background to
automatically change Windows wallpaper throught the day, every hour.

It's like the macOS dynamic wallpapers introduced in Mojave.

## DynamicWallpaper Packs
A DynamicWallpaper Pack is a collection of 24 wallpapers (representing 24 hours
of the day) named as `00.jpg`, `01.jpg`, `02.jpg`, ... , `23.jpg`.
Every collection should be inside a directory whose name is the pack's name.
And all the packs should be inside the `packs` directory.
